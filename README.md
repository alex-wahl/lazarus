## Page object model
Furthermore, it contains the page object model to have a nicer code.

## Most used commands:

Start testing a specific feature file by tag
- `mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@Test"`

Start all tests which you have
- `mvn test`

It will delete all previously compiled Java sources and resources (like .properties) in your project. 
- `mvn clean`

Next command will then compile, test & package your Java project and even install/copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.
- `mvn clean install`
